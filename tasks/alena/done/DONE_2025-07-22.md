Project Setup
- Initialized the full ft_transcendence folder structure from scratch
- Created frontend/backend/game/shared/tasks/docs directories
- Separated all code areas by teammate responsibility (Alena, Luis, Sveva)

 Tasks System
- Created per-person task folders: `todo/`, `done/` for Alena, Luis, Sveva
- Added placeholder `TODO_*.md` and `DONE_*.md` files
- Added `.gitkeep` in all empty folders to ensure Git tracks them

Documentation
- Created `/docs/` with files: `architecture.md`, `sockets.md`, `chat.md`, `customization.md`, etc.
- Wrote folder tree for the full project in `architecture.md` (to document layout)
