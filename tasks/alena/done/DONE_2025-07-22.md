P# ✅ DONE – Alena – 2025-07-22

## 📁 Team Task Structure Setup

- Created `tasks/` folder with separate subfolders for each teammate: `alena/`, `luis/`, `sveva/`
- Inside each teammate folder, added:
  - `todo/` for ongoing task planning
  - `done/` for daily logs and completion tracking
  - `TODO_<name>.md` placeholder
  - `PLAN_<name>.md` for detailed step-by-step plans
  - `DONE_<date>.md` template to track work

## 🧾 Project Plan

- Wrote clear task structure for the whole team in `tasks/README.md`, including:
  - 📋 Team member roles
  - 📦 Assigned modules per person
  - ⏳ Full timeline: 1 month slow + 1 month intensive
  - 📝 Friendly and organized team working rules
  - 💡 Notes on using Git, working in branches, tracking progress, and commenting respectfully in code



## 🔧 Status

- All setup tasks related to task tracking and project coordination are complete.
- Team is now fully unblocked and ready to start working independently.

__________________________________________________________________________________
- The full plan and explanation of how our project is organized (folders, responsibilities, data flow) is in:
  
  📄 `docs/architecture.md` – this file contains:
  - Folder structure
  - Who owns what
  - How frontend, backend, game, and sockets connect
  - A visual Mermaid diagram for full system flow
