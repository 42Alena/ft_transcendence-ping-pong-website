# Frontend â€“ Local Development

1. Install latest `node` (version 24+)

2. Install dependencies:

```sh
cd frontend
npm install
```

3. Run development server:
```sh
npm run dev
```
this will start the app at: http://localhost:5173

4. (Optional) Build for production:
```sh
npm run build
```

5. (Optional) Preview production build locally:
```sh
npm run preview
```

With Docker (optional, not set up yet)

Currently, the frontend runs locally using Vite.
Docker support can be added later if needed to match backend behavior.
