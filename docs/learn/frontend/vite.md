# ⚡ Vite – Beginner’s Guide (For All Ages)

## 🌐 What Is Vite?

**Vite** (pronounced "veet") is a fast tool for building modern web apps.  
It replaces older tools like Webpack with something faster, simpler, and more fun to use.

👉 Official site: [https://vitejs.dev](https://vitejs.dev)

You use Vite to start and build your React + TypeScript frontend quickly — with hot reloading and fast builds.

## 💡 Why We Use Vite in ft_transcendence

- ✅ Works perfectly with React and TypeScript  
- ✅ Fast hot reload (for UI testing and game screens)  
- ✅ Easy setup — no need to configure Webpack  
- ✅ Creates small, optimized production builds  

Vite helps us focus on building, not configuring.

## ⚙️ How Vite Works

- During development: uses native ES modules and runs super fast  
- During build: bundles your code using `esbuild` and `rollup`  
- Integrates easily with Tailwind, TypeScript, and React  

Vite is like a superpowerful server + bundler + optimizer all in one.

## 📁 What’s Inside Our Vite Frontend

Your frontend might look like this:

/frontend
├── public/ # static files (e.g. favicon)
├── src/
│ ├── App.tsx # main app layout
│ ├── index.tsx # React entry point
│ ├── components/ # buttons, screens, chat, etc.
│ └── styles/ # Tailwind config or custom CSS
├── vite.config.ts # Vite setup
├── tsconfig.json # TypeScript config
└── package.json # dependencies and scripts


---

## 🧪 Useful Vite Scripts

In `package.json`, you’ll often find:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "vite",
  "build": "vite build",
  "preview": "vite preview"
}


    npm run dev → starts local dev server at localhost:5173

    npm run build → builds production files to dist/

    npm run preview → runs a preview of the final build

## 🛠️ Vite Integrations We Use

  -  React → @vitejs/plugin-react

  -  TypeScript → .tsx support built-in

   - Tailwind CSS → added via postcss.config.cjs + tailwind.config.cjs

   - dotenv → reads .env by default

## 🧠 Tips for Vite Projects

   - Keep vite.config.ts clean and simple

  -  Use aliases (@/components) for easier imports

  -  Tailwind and TypeScript work great out of the box

 -   Use .env files for base URL, socket port, etc.
-
    In Docker: expose the port (5173) properly
