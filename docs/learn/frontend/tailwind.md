# 🎨 Tailwind CSS – Beginner’s Guide (For All Ages)

## 🌐 What Is Tailwind CSS?

**Tailwind CSS** is a modern way to style your website or app. It gives you **pre-made classes** that you put directly in your HTML to make things look good — fast.

👉 Official site: [https://tailwindcss.com](https://tailwindcss.com)

It’s like LEGO bricks for design — you don’t write new CSS, you just use utility classes like `bg-blue-500`, `text-center`, `rounded-xl`, `p-4`.

## ⚙️ How Tailwind Works

Tailwind adds a lot of CSS classes (utilities) to your HTML elements.  
Each class does one small job:

```html
<button class="bg-green-500 text-white p-2 rounded-lg">Start</button>


This makes a green button with white text, padding, and rounded corners — no CSS file needed.
