# 🎮 Game Customization – Beginner’s Guide (For All Ages)

## 🌐 What Is Game Customization?

Game customization means letting players **change how the game behaves or looks** — like speed, rules, graphics, power-ups, or modes.

In ft_transcendence, this is a **minor module** that upgrades the gameplay experience.

Players love being able to tweak things — and it helps us make the game more fun, replayable, and unique!

## 🧠 Why We Chose Game Customization

- ✅ It counts as a minor module  
- ✅ It’s fun and user-friendly  
- ✅ Easy to integrate with our existing UI  
- ✅ Works for both AI and multiplayer  

It gives players the power to make the game feel their own 🧩

## 🎛️ What Can Be Customized

We can allow players to modify things like:

- 🏓 **Ball speed** (faster or slower)  
- 🏃‍♂️ **Paddle size or speed**  
- 🔋 **Power-ups** (extra balls, fast mode, freeze)  
- 🗺️ **Background/theme** (color, classic style)  
- 👯‍♂️ **Game mode** (classic, chaos, 1v1, 2vAI)  

You can offer presets (like “Fast Mode”) or sliders + checkboxes.

## ⚙️ How It Works in Our App

- The player selects settings in the **game lobby or settings UI**  
- These settings are saved locally or sent to the backend via API or sockets  
- The game engine reads these values and applies them during the match  
- All players in a match receive the same configuration (to stay fair)  

Custom settings are part of the **match state**.

## 📦 Where to Store the Settings

You can store game settings:
- In memory (frontend state or localStorage)  
- In a DB (as part of a match record)  
- Sent through WebSocket during match start  

The game loop reads those values when rendering.

## 🧪 Tips for Customization UX

- Use sliders for numeric options (speed, size)  
- Use toggles/switches for power-ups  
- Add a reset-to-default button  
- Show tooltips or descriptions  
- Sync across all players before game starts  

Customization should be fun, but balanced ⚖️
